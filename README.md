I delved into the fascinating domain of customer churn prediction. Churn, also known as customer attrition, is a critical concern for businesses across various industries. The objective of this project was to build a predictive model that can identify customers who are at risk of churning. By understanding the patterns and factors leading to customer attrition, businesses can take proactive measures to retain their valuable clientele and optimize their operations.

To tackle this challenge, I followed a systematic approach. I began by gathering a comprehensive dataset containing customer-related information, such as demographic details, transaction history, usage patterns, and customer interactions. After a thorough data preprocessing phase, which involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing feature scaling, I conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the characteristics of churned and retained customers.
