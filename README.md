# Customer Churn Prediction Project

Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction project repository. In this project, I delved into the fascinating domain of customer churn prediction. Churn, also known as customer attrition, is a critical concern for businesses across various industries. The objective of this project was to build a predictive model that can identify customers who are at risk of churning. By understanding the patterns and factors leading to customer attrition, businesses can take proactive measures to retain their valuable clientele and optimize their operations.

## Project Overview

- Explored the challenge of customer churn prediction in the business context.
- Built a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning.
- Employed a systematic approach to tackle the problem.

## Approach

1. **Data Collection:** Gathered a comprehensive dataset containing customer-related information, including demographic details, transaction history, usage patterns, and customer interactions.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Conducted thorough data preprocessing to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis and modeling. This phase involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing feature scaling.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Carried out exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the characteristics of churned and retained customers. This step provided a deeper understanding of the dataset and potential patterns.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

## Usage

1. Install the necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the data preprocessing script, e.g., `python preprocess_data.py`.
3. Run the exploratory data analysis script, e.g., `python explore_data.py`.

## Files and Directories

- `preprocess_data.py`: Script for data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- `explore_data.py`: Script for exploratory data analysis, generating insights into the characteristics of churned and retained customers.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset files.
- `utils/`: Directory containing utility functions for data preprocessing and analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required dependencies.

## Dependencies
